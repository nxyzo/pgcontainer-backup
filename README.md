# pgcontainer-backup
This Bash script automates the process of backing up a **PostgreSQL** database running inside a **Docker container**. It includes safety mechanisms such as lock files to prevent concurrent backups, and optionally supports verbose logging and SHA256 checksums.

---

## 📦 Features

* Backs up PostgreSQL databases from Docker containers
* Uses `pg_basebackup` inside the container for a full physical backup
* Optional SHA256 checksum generation for data integrity verification
* Verbose logging support

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxyzo/pgcontainer-backup/refs/heads/main/pgcontainer-backup.sh)

./pgcontainer-backup.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Required Parameters

| Option                | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-n`, `--name`        | **(Required)** Name of the Docker container running PostgreSQL |
| `-d`, `--destination` | **(Required)** Host directory where backups will be stored     |
| `-u`, `--pg-user`     | **(Required)** PostgreSQL username                             |
| `-p`, `--pg-password` | **(Required)** PostgreSQL password                             |

### Optional Flags

| Option                    | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `-v`, `--verbose`         | Show detailed logs during the backup process |
| `-c`, `--create-checksum` | Generate SHA256 checksum for backup          |
| `-h`, `--help`            | Show help message and exit                   |

## 🧪 Example

```bash
./backup.sh \
  --name postgres_container \
  --destination /mnt/backups \
  --pg-user postgres \
  --pg-password secret \
  --verbose \
  --create-checksum
```

---

## 📁 Backup Output Structure

Each backup is stored in a subfolder named like:

```
pg_<container_name>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/
```

If checksum is enabled, a `checksum.sha256` file is also created in this folder:

```
pg_<container_name>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_full/
```

---

## 🔐 Safety Measures

* A lock file `/tmp/backup.lock` is created inside the container to prevent parallel backup jobs.
* If Docker is not running, the script attempts to start the Docker daemon automatically.
* All temporary folders inside the container are cleaned after the process.

---

## ✅ Requirements

* **Docker** (version 28.x required)
* A running **PostgreSQL Docker container**
* The user must have permission to execute Docker commands

---

## 🔧 Notes

* This script uses `pg_basebackup` and assumes your PostgreSQL container has the necessary tools installed.
* Do **not** forget to set proper backup directory permissions if running as root or from a cron job.
* The script is designed to be run from a host system, **not inside the container**.

* To properly back up the database, you need a dedicated backup user in the PostgreSQL container. You can create the user as follows:

```sql
CREATE ROLE backup_user WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'yourPassword';
```

---

## 🔍 Checksum Verification

To verify the integrity of your backup files, you can use the generated SHA256 checksums. This ensures that none of the files have been modified or corrupted after the backup process.

Use the following command to check all files inside a backup folder against the stored `checksum.sha256` file:

```bash
sha256sum $(find /path/to/backup -type f) | sha256sum --check /path/to/backup/checksum.sha256
```

✅ If everything is intact, you’ll see `OK` next to each file name.
⚠️ If a file was changed or is missing, the output will show `FAILED`.

## 🛠 Development To-Do

* Add support for retention/rotation policies
* Integrate email, discord or Slack notifications on backup success/failure
* Add logging to file for long-term auditability
* Add backup encryption
* Copy backup to remote location
